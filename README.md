### This is the basic template for cytubeEnhanced theme.

* `theme/screenshot.png` - theme's screenshot in themes list.

* `theme/config.js` loads theme's module from cytubeEnhanced and than adds your theme.

* `theme/theme.css` - theme's css.

* `theme/theme.js` - theme's javascript. You can put any code there and it will be executed after theme loaded.
By default it adds the tab in cytubeEnhanced settings with some options to control theme (http://i.imgur.com/4qbRvXA.png).
